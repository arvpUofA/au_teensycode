# Contributing

The more people that participate in correcting and enhancing code, the better the result is, so everyone with something to contribute is welcome to do so! 

Fork, then clone the repository and program your changes, making sure that the new version compiles and runs correctly.

Open up an issue with the problem description, the proposed solution and the tests done to make sure that there are no regression errors

Push to your fork and submit a gitHub pull request.

At this point the ball is no longer in your court but on our side. There will be a response within a couple of days, at most. 

Some things that will increase the spped at which a pull request is completed:

* Write tests.
* Follow the existing coding style (comments are done with [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/).
* Write as much information as a beginner would need to understand the problem and solution.
